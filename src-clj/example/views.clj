; When using {:optimizations :whitespace}, the Google Closure compiler combines
; its JavaScript inputs into a single file, which obviates the need for a "deps.js"
; file for dependencies.  However, true to ":whitespace", the compiler does not remove
; the code that tries to fetch the (nonexistent) "deps.js" file.  Thus, we have to turn
; off that feature here by setting CLOSURE_NO_DEPS.
;
; Note that this would not be necessary for :simple or :advanced optimizations.
